# Introduction
This repository is to create profile picture and cover photo. While watching a video on YouTube, [Magical shell history with rust | FOSDEM 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uyRmV19qJ2o), I found the presenter at the conference had a nice cover photo. I wanted to create something similar for myself. The presenter, [Ellie](https://github.com/ellie), is the creator of the cool shell history management tool - [atuin](https://atuin.sh/).
